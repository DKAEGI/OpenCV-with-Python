Capstone Project for implementing differnt openCV functions.
Defines a region of intrest to check for hand contours and counting the number of fingers displayed

Depending on the camera setup and the persons hand, the parameters need to be adjusted accordingly.

The file can be improved by using deep learning algorithms, to train a model with picture of hands, displaying different finger counts instead of calculating the fingers based on the distances.

Depending on the version of the libraries be used, some functions might not work ex. frame.copy()
